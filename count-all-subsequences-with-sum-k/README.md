# Count Subsequences With Sum = K

## Problem

Given an integer array `arr` and an integer `k`, return the **number of subsequences** whose sum equals `k`.

A **subsequence** is formed by deleting zero or more elements while maintaining the order (not necessarily contiguous).

## Input
- `arr[]` : integer array
- `k` : target sum

## Output
- Integer count of subsequences with sum `k`
