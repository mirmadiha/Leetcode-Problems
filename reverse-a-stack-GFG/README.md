<h1><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/reverse-a-stack/1">Reverse a Stack</a></h1>

You are given a stack St. You have to reverse the stack using recursion.

<h3>Example 1:</h3>

<h3>Input:</h3>
St = {3,2,1,7,6}
<h3>Output:</h3>
{6,7,1,2,3}
<h3>Explanation:</h3>
Input stack after reversing will look like the stack in the output.
<h3>Example 2:</h3>

<h3>Input:</h3>
St = {4,3,9,6}
<h3>Output:</h3>
{6,9,3,4}
<h3>Explanation:</h3>
Input stack after reversing will look like the stack in the output.
<h3>Your Task:</h3>

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function Reverse() which takes the stack St as input and reverses the given stack.

<h3>Expected Time Complexity:</h3> O(N2)
<h3>Expected Auxiliary Space:</h3> O(1)

<h3>Constraints:</h3>
1 <= size of the stack <= 104<br>
-109 <= Each element of the stack <= 109<br>
Sum of N over all test cases doesn't exceeds 106<br>
Array may contain duplicate elements.
